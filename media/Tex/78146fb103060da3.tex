The research group AVISPA is developing the PROMUEVA project, which aims to study polarization in social networks using a unified model.\\The project involves (1) Supporting the development of computational and analytical models for social networks that incorporate elements like communication, beliefs, and public/private messages, and (2) Formalizing the dynamic influence of agents in social networks and polarization.\\The project is using new polarization measures (COMETE and Bipol) to validate the relevance and effectiveness of these models.\\The goal is to create reliable implementations of these measures that can serve as a 'source of truth' for the research work and other investigations.\\
